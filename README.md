# Simple To-Do List App 📝

A learning project built with **React.js and Tailwind.css**.

## 📚 About the Project

A step-up from plain html, it was a fun and somewhat challanging experience. I learned alot about react concepts like states and hooks, and states.

For now, all data is stored in LocalStorage but in the very near future, I'll add an account system and backend functionality and hook up the database to an AWS s3bucket to allow users to access their data from any device. Until then, the app's not going to be live 😔.

I would also love to use this project to learn about react promises and using APIs from other apps. Until then 👋.

## ✍️ Update
I learnt about the importance of clean code documentation and decided to document my code. I'm still working on the bakend and simple account system, but it's not ready to be pushed yet. Until then 🤞.

## ✍️ Update
'hook up the database to an AWS s3bucket' was probably the dumbest thing I could have said 😂. Anyway, I'm done with the basic account system. There's some security issues, like, the password isn't hashed when it's saved, but I suppose it's fine for now. It's also not responsive for mobile. It would be live in a couple of hours.

## 🚀 Live Demo
The project is finally live 🥳. It's still not responsive for mobile though. Depending on when you’re reading this, the app might still be hosted via **AWS CloudFront**:
