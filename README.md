# Simple To-Do List App 📝

A learning project built with **React.js and Tailwind.css**.

## 📚 About the Project

A step-up from plain html, it was a fun and somewhat challanging experience. I learned alot about react concepts like states and hooks, and states.

For now, all data is stored in LocalStorage but in the very near future, I'll add an account system and backend functionality and hook up the database to an AWS s3bucket to allow users to access their data from any device. Until then, the app's not going to be live 😔.

I would also love to use this project to learn about react promises and using APIs from other apps. Until then 👋.

## 🙏 Thanks

Thanks for checking this out! This project is still unfinished, but I'd appriciate your feedback 👊.
