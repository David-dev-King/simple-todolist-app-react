# Simple To-Do List App 📝

A learning project built with **React.js and Tailwind.css**.



## 📚 About the Project

A step-up from plain html, it was a fun and somewhat challenging experience. I learned a lot about react concepts like states and hooks, and states.

For now, all data is stored in LocalStorage but in the very near future, I'll add an account system and backend functionality and hook up the database to an AWS s3bucket to allow users to access their data from any device. Until then, the app's not going to be live 😔.

I would also love to use this project to learn about react promises and using APIs from other apps. Until then 👋.



## ✍️ Update

I learnt about the importance of clean code documentation and decided to document my code. I'm still working on the backend and simple account system, but it's not ready to be pushed yet. Until then 🤞.



## ✍️ Update

'hook up the database to an AWS s3bucket' was probably the dumbest thing I could have said 😂. Anyway, I'm done with the basic account system. There's some security issues, like, the password isn't hashed when it's saved, but I suppose it's fine for now. It's also not responsive for mobile. It would be live in a couple of hours.



## 🚀 Live Demo
The project is finally live 🥳. It's still not responsive for mobile though. Depending on when you’re reading this, the app might still be hosted via **AWS CloudFront**:

## ✍️ Update

Basic mobile support added. I'd like to start by saying, I am by no means a designer, but it turned out ok if I do say so myself. Check it out with the same link above ☝️.



## ✍️ Update

Some much-needed security updates 😌.
-	Implemented password hashing
-	Utilizing environmental variables for security when pushing code.
I still have a lot to work on, like login persistence and cleaning up the UI. Until then, thanks for checking this out 🙏.



## ✍️ Update

Implemented Login persistence using JSON Web Tokens.


## 🙏 Thanks

Thanks for checking this out! This project is still unfinished, but I'd appreciate your feedback 👊.
